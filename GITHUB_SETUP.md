# Simple GitHub Setup Guide

Follow these 5 easy steps to put your project on GitHub:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" if you don't have an account
3. Choose a username and create your account

## Step 2: Create New Repository
1. Click the green "New" button (or go to github.com/new)
2. Name your repository: `broker-monitoring-system`
3. Make it **Public** (so others can see it)
4. **Don't** check any boxes (README, gitignore, license)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Get Your Code Ready
In your Replit project, open the Shell (bottom of screen) and run these commands one by one:

```bash
git init
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Broker monitoring system"
```

## Step 4: Connect to GitHub
Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/broker-monitoring-system.git
```

```bash
git branch -M main
```

## Step 5: Upload to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your code is now on GitHub at:
`https://github.com/yourusername/broker-monitoring-system`

## If You Get Errors:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub in your browser
- Check that your repository name matches exactly
- Try the commands again one by one

## Next Steps:
